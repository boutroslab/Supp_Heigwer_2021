## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: middle;">
The functional analysis of genes provides crucial information to understand cellular function. Further, the mapping of genetic interactions sheds light on how genes act in the emergence of cellular complexity. Here, we present the largest genetic interaction and morphological profiling screen in a metazoan cell to date. We profiled 680 000 pairwise RNAi perturbations in more than 38 billion cells and analyzed 73 morphological features by high-throughput imaging.
Our analysis identified related genes using similarities in their interaction and morphological profiles across the largest map of gene functional relationships in Drosophila to date. Building on this map, we benchmarked a new model to integrate morphological and genetic interaction profiles for accurate gene function prediction across 47 biological processes confirming known and revealing novel pathway regulators.
Furthermore, we re-constructed interaction maps specific to discrete cell states, assessing the impact of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. By this we describe how different cell states impact genetic interaction measurements down to a single cell level. In our analysis we found the synthetic sick interaction of Cdk2 and the CSN complex to cause the appearance of a novel subgroup of morphologically distinct cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms by correlative single-cell morphology and transcriptomics analysis.  This analysis revealed the genetic interaction between Cdk2 and the Cop9-signalosome as a synthetic trigger mechanism for a senescence-associated secretory phenotype in Drosophila cells. The secretion of antimicrobial peptides and simultaneous characteristic elongation of cells establish a link between cell morphology and immuno conversion in cell culture.
Together our data provide a genome-scale resource of gene functional profiles in Drosophila to date and show its utility in uncovering new mechanisms underlying genetic interaction and their plasticity towards cell-cell-heterogeneity.
